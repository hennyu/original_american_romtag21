# _Novelas originales y americanas_. Data and Scripts

This repository contains data and scripts for an analysis of references to identity (e.g. "novela original", "novela americana", "novela mexicana") in Spanish American 19th century novels. It accompanies a paper presented at the XXXVII. Romanistentag in 2021 ("_Novelas originales y americanas_: A Digital Analysis of References to Identity in Subtitles of Spanish American 19th Century Novels").

The bibliographic data and the text corpus that the analysis starts from have been published separately as [_Bib-ACMÃ©_](https://github.com/cligs/conha19) and [_Conha19_](https://github.com/cligs/bibacme).

For the text analysis, the tool [_stylo_](https://github.com/computationalstylistics/stylo) was used.
